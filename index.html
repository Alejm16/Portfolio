        <p id="about">Hi I'm Alejandor Munoz, I'm currently a Junior at the University of North Texas<br>
            I'm pursuing a Bachelors of Science in computer Science with a certificate in cyber security and will be graduating December 2021.<br>
            I began programming with Java during the Senior year or High School and have <br>
            moved to C++ and Python throughout High School. I have completed projects for <br>
            Provost at UNT, such as analyzing attendance for face to face classes after the <br>
            COVID-19 outbreak. I am currently learning Web Development, Investing, and e-commerce.<br>
            I'm also part of our Cubersecurity club and the Student Investment Group.</p>

        <h3> Provost Project</h3>
        <p>I have developed multiple projects with the C++ and Python Language. I developed a project for UNT's Office of Provost <br>
        which is responsible for UNT's academic mission and supervises UNT's academic program. Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, classes <br>
        where changed to remote learning while some classes were still offered face to face. My program was able to go through twenty thousand<br>
        students an calculate attendance percentage, week by week difference, and categorize the data by course section. <br></p>
        <h3> Contagion </h3>
        <p>Collaborated with team members to create a simulation engine that compares the impact of different vaccine distributions using C++. <br>
        Responsible for reading in the initial region population which is given by csv file and responsible for algorithm of vaccine distribution. <br>
        Reviewed other team members code for best results.
